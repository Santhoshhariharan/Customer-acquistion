# Customer Acquisition Data Analysis

This repository contains a Python script, `customeracquisition.py`, that performs data analysis on customer acquisition data to calculate various metrics including distribution cost, revenue, customer conversion, total revenue, return on investment (ROI), customer lifetime value (CLTV), and CLTV distribution value.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: 
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-acquisition-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd customer-acquisition-analysis
```

3. Open the `customeracquisition.py` script in your preferred text editor or IDE.

4. Modify the script to input your customer acquisition data. Ensure that your data is in the correct format and follows the required structure.

5. Run the `customeracquisition.py` script.

6. The script will perform the data analysis and calculate the following metrics:
   - Distribution cost: Total cost incurred in customer acquisition efforts.
   - Revenue: Total revenue generated from acquired customers.
   - Customer conversion: Percentage of customers converted from acquisition efforts.
   - Total revenue: Sum of revenue from all customers.
   - Return on Investment (ROI): Percentage return on the investment made in customer acquisition efforts.
   - Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV): Average value of a customer throughout their lifetime.
   - CLTV distribution value: Distribution of customer lifetime values.

7. The results will be displayed in the console or written to an output file, depending on the implementation in the script.
